1. Hybrid image main result

Include
Original and filtered input images
Hybrid image result
FFT images of each original and filtered image and the hybrid image
Description in a few sentences of how it works using the included images as illustrations.  Explain parameter settings and any clever ideas that are incorporated.  
All results must be based on your own images (can be from web with attribution, but not provided samples)

 
2. Hybrid image additional results

Include
At least two additional results (may not use provided samples). For each, include the input and hybrid image (do not need to show filtered or FFT images)
 

3. Image enhancement tasks (2 required, 3 for B&W)

Include
For at least two out of three enhancement tasks (each is worth 10 points), display original image, modified image, and explanation of how the image was modified


4. Quality of results and report

Nothing extra to include.


5. Color hybrid result (B&W)

Include
Original images, hybrid image
Explanation of method: Is it better to use color for the low-pass, the high-pass, or both?


6. Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids (B&W)

Include
Gaussian pyramid of main hybrid image result (can be one row of images)
Laplacian pyramid of main hybrid image result (another row of images)
